= Rest And Swagger

== Overview
This is a simple spring boot app which uses jpa and liquibase to manage a h2 database.
The purpose is to create an environment to investigate Swagger.
Everything else exists just to create a rest api or anything else which might be useful for this end.

== Swagger
When the application starts you can see Swagger UI at http://localhost:8090/restAndSwagger/swagger-ui.html.
